# Multivariate Analysis on Fish Species ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47324566/179405936-f27adf84-f7b1-452a-b57e-6fe57ca9db0a.png)


This project seeks to explore ways in which we can distinguish species of fish based on their measurements and see how they differ
and all of this will be accomplished using multivariate analysis techniques.

# Why Fish?

Multivariate Analysis is a perfect match for the robust and complex systems seen in modern biology, with it we can establish relationships between many biological variables that exist around us hence allowing us to establish patterns and make educated guesses or theories, I also like fishes so why not.

# Tool Used
-R studio 

# What are your findings?
In the doc attached I document the relationships between these variables extensively, please check it out
